Preface
===============================================================================

Welcome to Tarantool! This is the User Guide. We recommend reading it first, and
consulting Reference for more detail afterwards, if needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to read the documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started, you can either **download the whole Tarantool package**
as described in the first part of Chapter 2 "Getting Started",
or you can initially skip the download and
**connect to the online Tarantool server** running on the web at
http://try.tarantool.org.
Either way, as the first tryout you can follow the example
"Starting Tarantool and making your first database"
from the second part of Chapter 2.

Chapter 3 "Database" is about using Tarantool as a NoSQL DBMS, whereas
Chapter 4 "Application server" is about using Tarantool as an application server.

Chapter 5 "Server administration" is primarily for administrators.

Chapter 6 "Connectors" is strictly for users who are connecting from a different
language such as C or Perl or Python â€” other users will find no immediate need
for this chapter.

Appendix A contains reference information about Tarantool's database code errors.

Appendix B "Version-specific changes" summarizes significant changes introduced
in newer Tarantool versions.

For experienced users, there are also Reference documents,
a Contributor's Guide and an extensive set of comments in the source code.
